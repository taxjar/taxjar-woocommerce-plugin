Save hours every month by putting your sales tax on autopilot. Automated, multi-state sales tax calculation, collection, and filing.

== Description ==

[TaxJar](http://www.taxjar.com) eliminates the need for you to even think about sales tax with your WooCommerce store. This powerful extension calculates how much sales tax should be collected at checkout. Then we update your sales tax collected by state, county, and city on a daily basis for you to view at any time. Finally, we’ll file what you owe to the states for you.

Here’s why customers love this plugin:

* Rates are never out-of-date - TaxJar maintains more than 10,000 tax rates, updated monthly. No more manually uploading rate tables. Ever.
* US and Canada Support - Not only do you get US tax rates, this powerful extension also supports Canadian tax collection as well.
* Multi-state sales tax collection - Collect sales tax accurately in not just the state where you’re based, but in every state you have nexus.
* Daily tax preparation to avoid surprises - Every day we’ll download your sales and compile it by state, county, city, and special tax – exactly what you need to be able to file sales tax returns. No more last minute scrambling to get the data you need.
* AutoFile – automated sales tax filing - As deadlines approach, we’ll even file your returns and make your payments to the states you enroll in. No more forgetting and annoying penalties.
* Dead Simple pricing – No contracts. No activations fees. No credit card required. Use it as much as you want for 30 days for free. Beyond 30 days, pay based on the number of API calls you make each month.

Other Notable Features:

* Simple install – starting collecting sales tax in minutes
* Compatible with Woocommerce 2.3+ and Wordpress 4.2+
* Avoid sales tax surprises

== How It Works ==

Here’s how the TaxJar Smart Sales Tax API works.

TaxJar takes the following input from your store:

* Seller’s home state, city, and zip code
* Transaction amount
* The city, state, and zip code where item is being shipped
* Any shipping fees charged

And returns an accurate sales tax rate (including state, county, city, and special taxes) based on

* Seller's nexus based on your WooCommerce ship from settings
* Any nexus with other addresses stored in your TaxJar account
* Local sales tax sourcing laws (origin-based or destination-based)
* Shipping taxability laws (shipping is not taxable in every state)

TaxJar for WooCommerce automatically determines

* Nexus
* Origin vs. Destination sourcing
* Shipping taxability
* Sales tax rate (state county, city, special)
