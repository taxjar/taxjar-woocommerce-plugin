== Installation ==

Setting up sales tax with TaxJar is simple. [Read the documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/taxjar/) to learn more!

Or you can follow these steps to install the TaxJar plugin:

1. Install the plugin in your WordPress admin panel under *Plugins > Add New* (search for “TaxJar”) or [download the zip](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce.zip) and upload to `/wp-content/plugins` on your server.
2. Activate the plugin under *Plugins > Installed Plugins*.
3. Find the TaxJar configuration under *WooCommerce > TaxJar*.
4. Click the "Connect To TaxJar" button.
5. Sign in with your TaxJar account (or create a new one) in the popup.
6. Click the "Connect" button. The popup will automatically close and your WooCommerce store will be linked to your TaxJar account. Note: If your business exceeds 1,000 orders per month, you will be prompted to upgrade your account to TaxJar Professional in order to activate real-time sales tax calculations through the TaxJar API.
7. Fill out the rest of your settings. TaxJar requires your city and zip code from which you ship products to calculate sales tax. We automatically detect your country and state based on your WooCommerce configuration.
8. If you have multiple [nexus](https://blog.taxjar.com/sales-tax-nexus-definition/) states where you need to collect sales tax, make sure they're [added to your TaxJar account](https://app.taxjar.com/account#states). Click the “Sync Nexus Addresses” button to import your nexus addresses into WooCommerce.
9. Check the box next to “Enable TaxJar Calculations”.
10. If you plan to use TaxJar for sales tax reporting and filing, check the box next to "Enable order downloads to TaxJar" for TaxJar to connect and download the transactions on your store for [AutoFile](https://www.taxjar.com/autofile/) and reporting features.
11. Click “Save changes”. You're now up and running with TaxJar!

Suggested WooCommerce Tax Settings

== How It Works ==

Here’s how the TaxJar for WooCommerce plugin works:

At the cart and checkout page, TaxJar takes the following input from your store:

* Your store address
* Your customer's address
* Order details such as line items and shipping

And returns accurate sales tax (including state, county, city, and special taxes) based on...

* Your store address
* Any nexus locations stored in your TaxJar account
* Local sales tax sourcing laws (origin-based or destination-based)
* Shipping taxability laws (shipping is not taxable in every state)
* Product exemptions if configured for specific products
* Itemized discounts for coupons
* Sales tax holidays
